# Upstream policy

RHI Linux targets functional parity with [RankFTW/RHI](https://github.com/RankFTW/RHI) for Windows games running through Wine and Proton.

The current RHI Linux v0.9.23.4-beta.1 release contains reviewed behavior synchronized through the upstream RHI 2.7.5 line.

Functional parity is the goal; source-code or platform-implementation parity is not. When upstream provides a feature that can function under Wine/Proton, RHI Linux should expose the same capability and workflow, adapting the implementation where Linux requires it. A feature may remain unavailable when its required runtime behavior genuinely cannot function on the target Linux/Wine/Proton configuration.

Platform adaptations include:

- Avalonia instead of WinUI / Windows App SDK;
- Steam, Heroic, Lutris and standalone Wine discovery;
- Wine/Proton prefix registry handling and per-game DLL overrides;
- DXVK/VKD3D-Proton integration through the selected runner rather than Windows-native management;
- Windows driver APIs are adapted only where a functional Linux/Wine/Proton path exists;
- native Linux games are not targets for Windows DLL injection components.

RHI Linux remains a GPLv3 derivative of the upstream project.

## Parity notes (upstream 2.7.6–2.7.9)

- **Shaders (2.7.9):** upstream's global shader "Off" overriding per-game overrides does not apply: RHI Linux has no global shader mode or global selection fallback; each game's pack selection is stored on its own ReShade record. The custom-folder auto-tick fix is ported: dependency expansion never pulls in the local Custom Shaders pack; it deploys only when ticked explicitly.
- **ReShade (2.7.9):** the Custom-channel false update does not apply: the channel is stored on the ReShade record and rewritten by the apply that changes it, so the update check never sees a stale channel. Covered by tests.
